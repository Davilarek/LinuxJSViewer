# LinuxJSViewer
### After days of testing and fixing bugs, finally I publish source code for LinuxJSViewer, GUI for [LinuxJSEdition](https://github.com/Davilarek/LinuxJSEdition)

### At this moment it's highly unstable and doesn't contain anything but just a base.

## Credits
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - website on localhost
- [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) - websocket and communication
